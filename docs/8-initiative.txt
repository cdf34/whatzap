Commands to do with initiative.
,init-start
    Creates an initiative tracker in this channel.
    Until the "start" button is pressed, the channel is in auto-initiative mode: messages will be treated as initiatives (with the same syntax as init-add below) if they fit that syntax.
,init-add [$name] $number
    Add a character's initiative to an initiative tracker in this channel.
    If $name is not set, adds your character's initiative.
    If the character is already in the initiative order in this channel, gives you the option to replace it.
,init-add [$name] roll $bonus
    Rolls initiative for a character with bonus $bonus.
,init-add [$name] roll
    Rolls initiative for a character with the character's stored initiative bonus. Fails if the bonus is not set.
,init-modifier $character bonus
    Sets a character's initiative bonus.
