Quick start guide
Post `,create-pc $name` then your character name (e.g. `,create-pc Bob`) to get started.
Once you've done this, all posts in #in-game-group-text (or your server's equivalent) will appear as your character.
Add a photo with caption `,set-avatar me` to set your avatar.
Send a message as your character by preceding the message with two commas (e.g. `,,Good morning` will send "Good morning" as your character).
Send a message as an NPC by preceding the message with a comma then the NPC's name (e.g. `,Iris I'm a snake` will send "I'm a snake" as Iris).
Send a message `,help` to get the help menu.
