Commands to do with scheduling events.
,schedule $time-and-date
    Schedule the next event to be at $time-and-date. Fairly good at parsing different time and date forms. Currently assumes all times are GMT/BST. 
,schedule-reminders $args
    Sets when the bot will remind everyone of the event. $args should be a comma-separated list, with each entry being a number followed by either "m" for minutes or "h" for hours. E.g. ,schedule-reminders 5m, 1h, 24h
,reminder-channel [on/off]
    Turns event reminders in this channel on or off.
